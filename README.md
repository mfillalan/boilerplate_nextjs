This is a boilerplate project using: 
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for the front-end and API 
- [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the UI library
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database 
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as the ORM 
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for the development environment

## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

## Setup
1. Install all prerequisite applications.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Make sure Docker Engine is running.
4. Navigate to the folder you cloned the repository to in your choice of terminal.
5. Navigate to the app folder and run the command `npm i`
